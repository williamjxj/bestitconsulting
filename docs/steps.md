`v0.dev` provided the first version of the website, then `Vscode`+`Copilot` to improve.

## Vscode + Copilot

### Step 1

The logic is currently centralized in `/app/page.tsx`. Please extract it into individual components to improve code organization, so I can use next Router to navigate between these pages.

### Step 2

I want to implement eslint + prettier + editorconfig to improve code quality.

### Step 3

Add a markdownlint.json to ignore MD warnings.

### Step 4

In order to enhance the effectiveness and appeal of bestitconsulting.ca for outsourcing clients, please prepare a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (`prd.md`) and place it in the `docs/` folder.

### Step 5

Dynamic category and language support, and the ability to add new categories and languages.

### Step 6

create github repo

### Step 7

- use `manus` to analyse this github repo project: `manus-report.md`
