# Data Model: UI Enhancement for Software Outsourcing Projects

**Feature**: UI Enhancement for Software Outsourcing Projects
**Date**: 2025-01-27
**Purpose**: Define data structures and entities for animation and UI enhancement components

## Animation Configuration Entity

**Entity**: AnimationConfig
**Purpose**: Centralized configuration for all animation behaviors and settings

**Fields**:
- `id: string` - Unique identifier for animation configuration
- `name: string` - Human-readable name for the animation
- `type: AnimationType` - Type of animation (fade, slide, scale, rotate, etc.)
- `duration: number` - Animation duration in milliseconds
- `delay: number` - Animation delay in milliseconds
- `easing: EasingType` - Easing function for animation curve
- `direction: DirectionType` - Animation direction (up, down, left, right, in, out)
- `stagger: number` - Stagger delay for multiple elements
- `threshold: number` - Intersection observer threshold for scroll triggers
- `reducedMotion: boolean` - Whether animation respects prefers-reduced-motion
- `mobileOptimized: boolean` - Whether animation is optimized for mobile devices

**Validation Rules**:
- Duration must be between 100ms and 2000ms
- Delay must be non-negative
- Threshold must be between 0 and 1
- Easing must be a valid CSS easing function

**State Transitions**:
- `idle` → `preparing` → `animating` → `completed`
- `completed` → `idle` (for repeatable animations)

## Animation Variant Entity

**Entity**: AnimationVariant
**Purpose**: Predefined animation variants for consistent behavior across components

**Fields**:
- `id: string` - Unique identifier for variant
- `name: string` - Variant name (e.g., "fadeIn", "slideUp", "scaleIn")
- `initial: AnimationState` - Initial state of the animation
- `animate: AnimationState` - Target state of the animation
- `exit: AnimationState` - Exit state of the animation
- `transition: TransitionConfig` - Transition configuration
- `responsive: ResponsiveConfig` - Responsive behavior configuration

**Validation Rules**:
- Initial, animate, and exit states must be valid CSS properties
- Transition configuration must include duration and easing
- Responsive configuration must include breakpoint-specific settings

## Component Animation Entity

**Entity**: ComponentAnimation
**Purpose**: Animation configuration for specific UI components

**Fields**:
- `componentId: string` - ID of the component being animated
- `animationId: string` - Reference to AnimationConfig
- `variantId: string` - Reference to AnimationVariant
- `trigger: TriggerType` - What triggers the animation (mount, scroll, hover, click)
- `conditions: AnimationCondition[]` - Conditions that must be met for animation
- `fallback: FallbackConfig` - Fallback behavior for unsupported scenarios

**Validation Rules**:
- Component ID must reference existing component
- Animation ID must reference valid AnimationConfig
- Trigger must be a valid trigger type
- Conditions must be logically consistent

## Visual Enhancement Entity

**Entity**: VisualEnhancement
**Purpose**: Configuration for visual effects and enhancements

**Fields**:
- `id: string` - Unique identifier for enhancement
- `type: EnhancementType` - Type of enhancement (particle, gradient, shadow, etc.)
- `intensity: number` - Intensity level of the enhancement (0-100)
- `color: string` - Color configuration for the enhancement
- `position: PositionConfig` - Position and alignment configuration
- `responsive: ResponsiveConfig` - Responsive behavior
- `performance: PerformanceConfig` - Performance optimization settings

**Validation Rules**:
- Intensity must be between 0 and 100
- Color must be valid CSS color value
- Position must include valid CSS positioning values
- Performance settings must include optimization flags

## Animation State Entity

**Entity**: AnimationState
**Purpose**: Represents the current state of an animation

**Fields**:
- `id: string` - Unique identifier for state
- `componentId: string` - ID of the component in this state
- `currentState: string` - Current animation state (idle, preparing, animating, completed)
- `progress: number` - Animation progress (0-1)
- `startTime: number` - Timestamp when animation started
- `endTime: number` - Timestamp when animation will end
- `paused: boolean` - Whether animation is paused
- `cancelled: boolean` - Whether animation was cancelled

**Validation Rules**:
- Progress must be between 0 and 1
- Start time must be before end time
- State must be valid animation state

## Performance Metrics Entity

**Entity**: PerformanceMetrics
**Purpose**: Track performance metrics for animations

**Fields**:
- `id: string` - Unique identifier for metrics
- `componentId: string` - ID of the component being measured
- `fps: number` - Frames per second during animation
- `renderTime: number` - Time taken to render animation frame
- `memoryUsage: number` - Memory usage during animation
- `batteryImpact: number` - Battery impact score (mobile devices)
- `accessibilityScore: number` - Accessibility compliance score

**Validation Rules**:
- FPS must be positive number
- Render time must be positive number
- Memory usage must be non-negative
- Battery impact must be between 0 and 100
- Accessibility score must be between 0 and 100

## Relationships

- **AnimationConfig** → **AnimationVariant** (one-to-many)
- **AnimationVariant** → **ComponentAnimation** (one-to-many)
- **ComponentAnimation** → **AnimationState** (one-to-one)
- **ComponentAnimation** → **VisualEnhancement** (one-to-many)
- **AnimationState** → **PerformanceMetrics** (one-to-one)

## Data Flow

1. **Configuration**: AnimationConfig defines base animation settings
2. **Variants**: AnimationVariant provides reusable animation patterns
3. **Components**: ComponentAnimation applies animations to specific components
4. **State**: AnimationState tracks current animation status
5. **Enhancement**: VisualEnhancement adds visual effects
6. **Metrics**: PerformanceMetrics monitors animation performance

## Validation and Constraints

- All entities must have unique IDs
- Animation configurations must be valid and performant
- Component references must exist
- Performance metrics must be within acceptable ranges
- Accessibility requirements must be met
- Mobile optimization must be considered
