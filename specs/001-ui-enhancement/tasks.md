# Tasks: UI Enhancement for Software Outsourcing Projects

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-ui-enhancement/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [x] T002 [P] Install animation dependencies (framer-motion, gsap, @tailwindcss/typography, class-variance-authority, clsx)
- [x] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools for animation components
- [x] T004 [P] Setup TypeScript configuration for animation types
- [x] T005 [P] Configure Tailwind CSS v4 with animation utilities

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T006 Setup animation configuration system in lib/animations.ts
- [x] T007 [P] Create Framer Motion animation variants in lib/framer-variants.ts
- [x] T008 [P] Implement accessibility utilities for reduced motion in lib/accessibility.ts

- [x] T010 Setup animation wrapper components structure in components/animations/
- [x] T011 Configure performance monitoring for animations
- [x] T012 Setup animation asset management in public/animations/

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Enhanced Visual Impact (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Create immediate visual impact through hero section animations and professional design elements

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by measuring user engagement metrics (time on page, bounce rate, conversion rate) and conducting user interviews to assess visual appeal and professional impression.

### Tests for User Story 1 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Trust and Credibility Building (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Build trust and credibility through professional design elements and technical demonstrations

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by measuring client inquiries, demo requests, and conversion rates from website visitors to qualified leads.

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Animation wrapper components before hero components
- Hero components before page implementations
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Animation wrapper components within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all animation wrapper components for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create FadeIn animation wrapper in components/animations/FadeIn.tsx"
Task: "Create SlideIn animation wrapper in components/animations/SlideIn.tsx"
Task: "Create ScaleIn animation wrapper in components/animations/ScaleIn.tsx"

# Launch all hero components for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create AnimatedText component with typewriter effect in components/hero/AnimatedText.tsx"
Task: "Create ParticleBackground component in components/hero/ParticleBackground.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Hero animations)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Professional design)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Competitive differentiation)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
