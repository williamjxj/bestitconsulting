# Implementation Plan: UI Enhancement for Software Outsourcing Projects

**Branch**: `001-ui-enhancement` | **Date**: 2025-01-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-ui-enhancement/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Enhance the BestIT Consulting website UI with modern animations, visual effects, and interactive elements using framer-motion and other UI libraries to create an eye-catching, professional appearance that attracts software outsourcing clients. The implementation will focus on hero section animations, scroll-triggered effects, micro-interactions, and performance-optimized visual enhancements.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5, React 19, Next.js 15.2.4
**Primary Dependencies**: framer-motion, @tailwindcss/typography, class-variance-authority, clsx, lucide-react, gsap
**Storage**: N/A (UI enhancement only)
**Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Storybook for component testing
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) with modern CSS and JavaScript support
**Project Type**: Web application (Next.js frontend)
**Performance Goals**: 90+ Core Web Vitals score, <3s initial load time, 60fps animations
**Constraints**: Must maintain accessibility (WCAG 2.1), support prefers-reduced-motion, mobile-first responsive design
**Scale/Scope**: Single website with 5-8 pages, 20+ animated components, 4+ language support

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

**Modern Web Stack**: Feature MUST use Next.js 15.2.4, React 19, TypeScript 5
**Component-First**: All UI elements MUST be React components with TypeScript
**Internationalization**: All user-facing content MUST support i18n framework
**Quality Standards**: Code MUST pass ESLint 9, Prettier, TypeScript strict mode
**Performance & Accessibility**: Components MUST be accessible with ARIA attributes
**Developer Experience**: MUST use Turbopack and established tooling patterns
