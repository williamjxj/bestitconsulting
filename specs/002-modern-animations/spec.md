# Feature Specification: Modern Dynamic Animations

**Feature Branch**: `002-modern-animations`
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "improve UI with more modern and dynamic animation css"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Enhanced Visual Experience (Priority: P1)

As a website visitor, I want to experience smooth, modern animations that make the interface feel responsive and engaging, so that I am impressed by the technical sophistication and professional quality of the website.

**Why this priority**: First impressions are critical for a consulting website. Modern animations demonstrate technical expertise and create immediate visual impact that builds credibility with potential clients.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by visiting the website and observing that all animations are smooth, performant, and enhance the user experience without being distracting.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user visits the homepage, **When** they scroll through sections, **Then** content should animate smoothly into view with fade-in and slide-up effects
2. **Given** a user hovers over interactive elements, **When** they move their cursor, **Then** elements should respond with subtle hover animations that provide visual feedback
3. **Given** a user clicks on buttons or links, **When** they interact with them, **Then** they should see satisfying micro-interactions that confirm their actions

### User Story 2 - Performance-Optimized Animations (Priority: P2)

As a user on any device, I want animations to be smooth and performant without causing lag or battery drain, so that I can enjoy the enhanced experience without technical issues.

**Why this priority**: Poor performance can negate the benefits of animations and create a negative user experience, especially on mobile devices or slower connections.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by measuring animation performance metrics and ensuring smooth 60fps animations across different devices and connection speeds.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user on a mobile device, **When** they interact with animated elements, **Then** animations should maintain 60fps without causing stuttering or lag
2. **Given** a user with a slow connection, **When** they load the website, **Then** animations should still work smoothly without impacting page load times
3. **Given** a user with motion sensitivity, **When** they have reduced motion preferences enabled, **Then** animations should be minimized or disabled appropriately

### User Story 3 - Advanced Visual Effects (Priority: P3)

As a potential client, I want to see sophisticated visual effects that showcase technical capabilities, so that I can trust the company's expertise in modern web development.

**Why this priority**: Advanced effects demonstrate technical prowess and differentiate the website from competitors, but should not compromise performance or accessibility.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by observing that advanced visual effects are implemented without impacting performance or accessibility standards.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user views the hero section, **When** the page loads, **Then** they should see engaging particle effects or gradient animations that create visual interest
2. **Given** a user navigates between sections, **When** they scroll, **Then** they should experience smooth parallax effects and layered animations
3. **Given** a user interacts with portfolio items, **When** they hover or click, **Then** they should see sophisticated hover effects and transitions that showcase attention to detail

### Edge Cases

- What happens when users have motion sensitivity and prefer reduced motion?
- How does the system handle users on very old devices with limited animation support?
- What happens when users have slow internet connections that might struggle with complex animations?
- How does the system handle users with screen readers or other assistive technologies?
- What happens when animations conflict with user interactions or cause accessibility issues?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain 60fps animation performance across all devices and browsers
- **FR-006**: System MUST be accessible with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
- **FR-007**: System MUST respect prefers-reduced-motion for all animations and visual effects
- **FR-008**: System MUST be optimized for mobile devices with touch-friendly interactions
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain performance standards with Core Web Vitals compliance
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide fallback animations for older browsers that don't support modern CSS features
- **FR-011**: System MUST ensure animations enhance rather than distract from content readability
- **FR-012**: System MUST implement animation performance monitoring and optimization

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_
